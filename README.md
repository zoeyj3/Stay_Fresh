[Stay Fresh 1.0 Demo](https://stayfresh1.netlify.app/).

## Overview

Stay Fresh is a refrigerator management web application that helps users meticulously track every item in their refrigerator, set freshness timelines for different categories, and access this information anytime, anywhere. The application lists all inventory items, alerts users to consume food before it expires, and provides corresponding recipes.

## Key Features
Inventory Management: Easily log every item in your refrigerator and categorize them by type.

Freshness Timelines: Assign specific freshness durations for each category to ensure optimal consumption timing.

Expiration Alerts: The app proactively lists all inventory items and alerts users as the expiration dates approach, helping to minimize food waste.

Recipe Suggestions: Receive tailored recipe recommendations based on the current contents of your refrigerator, making meal planning both simple and creative.

## Benefits:
Stay Fresh transforms the way users interact with their food inventory. By promoting timely consumption and reducing waste, the application not only saves money but also supports a more sustainable lifestyle. It helps users check their food stock status anytime and anywhere, preventing over-purchasing and overstocking. Furthermore, Stay Fresh aids in meal planning by suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, fostering healthier eating habits and making meal preparation a breeze. This application is ideal for anyone looking to optimize kitchen efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

## APIs
Stay Fresh utilizes external data from:
TheMealDB API for fetching recipe data. More information can be found here(https://www.themealdb.com/).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
